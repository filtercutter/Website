## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.

First and foremost, I will never share your email address or any other personal information to anyone without your direct consent. Period.

All of this information is not linked to anything that is personally identifiable.

### Cookies and web beacons

Like nearly all Websites, this website stores "convenience" cookies on your computer whenever you leave a comment. These cookies record the name, and email address that you enter when you submit a comment so that you wont have to re-type that information the next time you leave a comment.

Third-party advertisers may also place and read cookies on your browser and/or use web beacons to collect information. This website has no access or control over these cookies. You should review the respective privacy policies on any and all third-party ad servers for more information regarding their practices and how to opt-out.

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

Just like this site, my Disclosure Policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.

Your use of this site, in any and all forms, constitutes an acceptance of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is reviewed and revised from time to time. You will want to revisit it regularly.
