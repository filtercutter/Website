To mark the release we've also commissioned a sexy t-shirt from Nous Sommes Des Soleils. The shirt is made by a friend in a small workshop factory from Belgrade, and some elements are sewn by hand. We've worked with the maker to develop a custom garment so it is slightly longer than usual with a wider neck. It is designed to be loose and cool, so it's available in M (ideal for women and smaller men), L (ideal for larger women and skinny men), and XL (ideal for most people). To be honest XL is the look we're going for with this. Currently the shirt is only available in a bundle with the vinyl in a strictly limited edition of 40 worldwide. Get it direct from our shop.
