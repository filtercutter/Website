The concept is put together by Filtercutter. With a will to perform Live Dubstep. It was made as a collaboration of a friends musicians, kind of a unique thing in the Balkan region at the time. With all the techy equipment and trippy sounds are made by jam sessioning and experiments on the fly. Band was active during 2008. and 2009. 

mixing desk + sampler + keyboards + drums + microphones = <3

Filtercutter was pulling the strings with the main sampler and a mixing desk, together with two keyboardists (Bojan, Darja) and a percussion player (Stung).

Usually there was also the helping microphone force coming from Mc Bojah and Mc Techs. They were bringing the vibes up with their rhymes 'n flow.
