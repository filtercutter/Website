This is a concept put together by Filtercutter, with a will to perform Live Dubstep. Band was active during 2008. and 2009. It was made as o collaboration with a friendly musicians, and was kind of a unique thing in the Balkan region at the time. All hardwere equipment, and original tunes done by jam session experiments on the fly.

mixing desk - sampler - keyboards - drums + microphones

Filtercutter was pulling the strings with the main sampler and a mixing desk, together with two keyboardists (Bojan, Darja) and a percussion player (Stung).

Usually there was also the helping microphone force from Mc Bojah and Mc Techs. They were bringing the vibes up with their rhymes 'n flow.

The band didn't last very long, because of the high demands for practicing toghether, so it seemd too compcicated. All of the members had their separate, very demanding projects. Anyway, this will stay remembered in the harts of some of Belgrades most hard core bass culture fans.
