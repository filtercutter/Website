This is an effect box prototype, for live video performances and effects for DJs and live acts. Based on the video op-amp chip found usually in analog VHS players. Effects are made by circuit bending the chip with potentiometers. Modulation can be controlled trough MIDI signal. Transistors are switching the notes on and off, that way triggering modulation.
