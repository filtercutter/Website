Prototyping box for implementing different development ideas directly embedded. It consist of ARM m7 chip and analog / digital hardware UI components.

Recycled materials were used as parts e.g. buttons caps and joystick are form the PlayStation. The box is made with a laser-cutter.

I am considering an option to make hardware and software open source and available on Github page.
