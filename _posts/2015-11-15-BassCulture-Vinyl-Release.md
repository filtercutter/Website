You can order this niceness pack at <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk/products/istari-lasterfahrer-selektor-depender-filtercutter-digital-dub/593174-01/" target="_blank">Juno.co.uk</a>

Here we are particularly interested about Digital Dub Version. It's featuring a colab tune between Filtercutter and Selector Depender founder of Bassculture Amsterdam Soundsystem. Digi-dub flip of the original tune "Digital Age" by EARL 16! The record also features Istari Lasterfuhrer's massive Dub. I'm trilled to be part of this lovely release.
